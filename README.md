onkyo2mqtt
==========

Bridge between the Onkyo AVR EISCP protocol and MQTT

It's intended as a building block in heterogenous smart home environments where an MQTT message broker is used as the centralized message bus.

If you don't understand any of the above, hm2mqtt is most likely not useful to you.
